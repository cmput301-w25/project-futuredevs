## Project Description

This project focuses on recording mood events, each consisting of a mood, a reason behind it, and the social situation in which it occurred. Users can sign up and log in and each user can add, delete, view, filter, and modify their mood events, and also upload images related to those events.
Users can follow and unfollow others to view their shared mood events. Follow requests can be sent by:
- Searching for a user's name on the Search page
- Navigating to a user's profile by finding them in the comments section of a mood post
Once a request is sent, the recipient can approve or decline it.
Additionally, users can interact with mood posts through a nested commenting feature, allowing for threaded discussions and social interaction.
